## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction
My name is Yash Walia, and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Geodesy and Geo-informatics at Leibniz UniversitÃ¤t Hannover. Before joining the program, I accumulated over five years of experience in the GIS services industry in India. I am deeply fascinated by the intricate interplay of components within ecosystems and the universe, and I aspire to understand these systems better. My goal is to apply this knowledge to develop innovative solutions.

potential flooding zones** 
Project Summary:
 * Processed large temporal dataset of satellite imagery.
 * Extracted binary images using different indexes to see the changes in river routes in different seasons for multiple years to identify potential flooding zones.
 * Tools and Technologies Used: Google Earth Engine, ArcMap, and QGIS


## Work Experience
### Senior Associate Consultant, [Infosys Limited](https://www.infosys.com/)    
####  02/2021 â€“ 02/2024, Mysore, Karnataka, India
 * Performing different workflows to maintain the pipeline integrity spatially using linear referencing
 * principles.
 * Making updates in the geometry and pipeline features in case of pipe replacement or diverted pipe route.
 * Aligning data produced by the Inline Inspection tool to pipeline and refining pipeline utilizing the data, if spatially accurate.
 * Running High Consequence Analysis (HCAs) to analyze the impact and scope of spill in the surrounding areas.
 * Pre-processing the data using Python Scripts, Excel and GIS applications (ArcMap & ArcGIS Online platforms) and utilizing PLOS (Pipeline Office Studio) and SQL scripts to push the data into the PODS database.
 * Worked on data from the US, UK, Asia Pacific, and Canada's pipeline systems for ExxonMobil.
 * Finding ways to automate the repetitive process and updating procedures for better efficiency and accuracy 
 * Delivering knowledge transfer sessions to the new recruits.
 * Creating process and writing documentation for new tasks.

### GIS Analyst, [Cybertech Systems and Software Ltd](https://cybertech.com/)
#### 07/2018 â€“ 01/2021, Thane, Maharashtra, India
* Worked closely with clients and vendors to comprehend the requirement and suggest best practices and guided in implementing and configuring ESRI applications.
* Provided Technical Support to ESRI users in deploying ArcGIS Enterprise (ArcGIS Server, Portal for ArcGIS, ArcGIS Data Store, and ArcGIS Web Adaptor), ArcGIS Desktop, and ArcGIS Pro, guided them in the usage of these applications and addressed their queries.
* Extensively involved in troubleshooting software issues, developing appropriate workflows, and contributing to internal documentation and logging bugs.
* Completed trainings for ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

### Summer Intern, [Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS)](https://www.iirs.gov.in/)
#### Project: Cloud based Geo-processing of Satellite Data using Google Earth Engine
#### Mentors: Sc. Dr. S.K.Shrivastava and Sc. Prasun Gupta
####  06/2017 â€“ 08/2017, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India

* An approach to monitoring surface water spread using GEE, this study uses about three decades (1984 to 2016) of satellite images in a part of the Ghaghara river basin in the State of Uttar Pradesh of India.
* Used over 500 satellite images about the monsoon season from Landsat and MODIS series
* Observed high correspondence between the active flood plain and the frequency of surface water occurrence delineated from time-series satellite images
* Concluded that such composite long-term surface water spread maps can help in flood hazard zonation and a developmental plan.
